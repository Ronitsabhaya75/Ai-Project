Good job identifying that this avoids the nested loop O(nÂ²) solution. You've also handled edge cases well. I'd score your solution at 85/100. To improve, consider discussing the space complexity trade-offs and perhaps mentioning alternative approaches even if they're less optimal."

I particularly liked your real-world examples. You could improve by discussing some design patterns and their practical applications. Overall, I'd rate your performance at 82/100. You showed good conceptual knowledge but could strengthen the discussion of trade-offs between different OOP approaches."

I appreciate how you highlighted both your individual contribution and team collaboration. For improvement, try to quantify your impact more precisely. I'd rate your performance at 88/100.

You correctly identified the need for a URL mapping database, a hashing function, and an API layer. Your discussion of scalability using a distributed cache was particularly strong. Areas for improvement include more detailed discussion of database partitioning strategies and analytics capabilities. Overall, I'd rate your performance at 78/100. You covered the core aspects well but could go deeper on reliability and data consistency concerns."
